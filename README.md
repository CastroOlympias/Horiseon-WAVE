# Code Refactor Starter Code

Improve to index.html and styles.css

I improved the sematic html elements

I improved index.html classes, combining them with common tyles, to reduce the number of classes and to remove redundant styles within styles.css

I entered descriptive notes in the index.html and syles.css to better organize, and identify sections as well as matched the style.css flow with the index.html code. This improves mapping and locating index.html elements with styles.css styles.

I removed unnecessary boxes/elements within index.html and styles from stylse.css that provided no feature, function or visual enhancements to the application.

I made sure to fix broken hyperlinks and added alt attributes to the image links

I changed the title name to Horiseon - WAVE
